Playing tetris:
	
	Left and Right arrow keys move the piece side to side
	Press down to force the piece to move down, this will add bonus points
		*If down is not pressed, the piece moves automatically after a short time
		
	Z and X rotate the piece
	
	Once a piece cannot move down anymore, it is locked in place, and a new piece is spawned.
	If a piece impacts either the bottom of the field or another piece, there is still a short time window
	to move or rotate the piece. If you can get the piece unstuck within this time window, it can continue moving down.
	
	If a line gets filled, it is removed. The same goes for several lines being filled at once.
	Scoring is as follows:
		1 Line(s) (Single): 40   points
		2 Line(s) (Double): 100  points
		3 Line(s) (Triple): 300  points
		4 Line(s) (Tetris): 1200 points
	
	The game will end in one of two ways:
		The middle area at the top of the field is filled, preventing new pieces from being spawned
		Pieces are stacked above a few spaces beyond the top of the field
